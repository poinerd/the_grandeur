            <p style={{textAlign:"left"}}>
            I’m a maker passionate about Product Design and Software Engineering.
Born in Nigeria, I grew up doodling in notebooks and building car models from noodle cartons — a spark that grew into a lifelong drive to make great things through design, art, writing, software, and hardware.

With experience in multidisciplinary design — from motion and brand design to product design — and software development with JavaScript, Node.js, and Python, I love turning ideas into functional, meaningful experiences.

I’m inspired by slow music, great paintings, and the beauty of thoughtful craftsmanship — and I never miss a good joke.
Someday, I hope to explore robotics and AI — anything that challenges me to keep making.

            <p>
                I grew up in Nigeria doodling in my book and making car models with noodles cartons. I have the passion for making things
and it has become my ambition to dedicate my life to making great stuff- Design, art, writing, software and hardware. I love slow music and great paintings. I love to tell good jokes

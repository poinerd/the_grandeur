                I grew up in Nigeria doodling in my book and making car models with noodles cartons. I'm a creative person with a love for making things. 
and it has become my ambition to dedicate my life to making great stuff- Design, art, writing, software and hardware. I love slow music and great paintings. I love to tell good jokes
